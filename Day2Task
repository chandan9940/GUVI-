5)Use Type of in all the data types and check the result 
	typeof(1)            : number
	typeof(1.1)          : number
	typeof("1.1")        : string
	typeof(true)         : boolean
	typeof(null)         : object
	typeof(undefined)    : undefined
	typeof([])           : object
	typeof({})           : object

6)blog on objects and internal representation in javascript 
           
                                             OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JS
Objects are very most important in each and every language.In java script we have primitive data types called String ,number,boolean,null and object is a composite data type in java script. primitive data types can store only single value where as objects can store multiple values of primitive data in it. Primitive data types are of copy by value and composite data types are copy by reference in js.

Example 1:

var a = 30;
var b =a;
var b = 20;
console.log(a)//gives 30 ->copy by value

Example 2:
var arr = [3];
var arr1 = arr;
arr1[0]= 5;
console.log(arr)//gives [5] ->copy by reference

Array:

Array is an object in JavaScript and it is of indexing based lets see below example
var arr = [1,”two”,3.5,[4,5,6,7]]
arr in above example is an array so in an array we can declare any data type like string int float and even another array and object as well. So we said array is indexed based it means indexing start from 0 to end of array for example if we want to retrive third element we can do by arr[2] //gives 3.5.

JSON OBJECT:

JSON object is a key value pair in JavaScript where as array is index based key should be of string type and value can be anything like int float string array an another JSON object also and can be function also.lets see and example .
var json = {“name”:”xyz”, ”number”: 9940107129,[1,2,3,4,5]}
json is an JSON object in above example we can retrive value of json object by using json[“name”] or json.name//gives xyz. Lets see another example.If we give number or any other data type than string in key it will automatically convert into string data type. lets see one example below to demonstrate that
var json = {10: ”apple”};
above example will be treated as var json = {“10”: ”apple”};
To retrive the apple in above example we use json[“10”]//gives apple.
Value as function in JSON OBJECT
var json = {“name”:”xyz” ,”number” : 9940107129, fun: function(){console.log(json.name,json.number)}}//gives xyz,9940107129.
