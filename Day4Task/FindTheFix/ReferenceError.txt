=================== ReferenceError: event is not defined==========

This error is thrown when you try to access a variable that is undefined or 
access outside the current scope. You can test it very easily in Chrome browser.

function testFun(){
    var foo;
}
console.log(foo);

output:
Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined


If you’re getting this error when using the event handling system,
make sure you use the event object passed in as a parameter. 

Older browsers like IE offer a global variable event, and
Chrome automatically attaches the event variable to the handler. 
Firefox will not automatically add it. 
Libraries like jQuery attempt to normalize this behavior. 

it’s best practice to use the one passed into your event handler function.

document.addEventListener("mousemove", function (event) {
  console.log(event);
})
